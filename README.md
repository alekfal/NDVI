# NDVI
A NDVI Python Script that works with a *.tif NIR band and a *.tif RED band and gives as output a new NDVI image in *.tif format. To run this script, it’s important the name of the RED band to be “red.tif“, the name of the NIR band “nir.tif“ and all of them to be in the same folder (Python Script, nir.tif and red.tif).
